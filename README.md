All files related to code can be accesed in the zip file provided.

In this lab, I built an app where a single activity will rotate as the screen rotates. I first added in all the buttons and features that I wanted and tested it. In order to improve the orientation of the buttons, I created another activity_xml file in order for the buttons to look good in the landscape position. I added in the same code from other activity_xml file to make sure the same features appear when the phone rotates to landscape mode.
